# City Learning

## About

This repository contains a study case of the work developed by Kathirgamanathan, A. et al. in * A Centralised Soft Actor
Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to District Demand Side Management through CityLearn* [1] and by 
Vazquez-Canteli, J. in CityLearn: Standardizing Research in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Demand Response and
Urban Energy Management [2]. Also, is based on the GitHub public repository *Actor-Critic-Methods-Paper-To-Code* [3].

## Work Environment

To use this repository it is essential to clone the public repository 
[*Actor-Critic-Methods-Paper-To-Code*](https://github.com/philtabor/Actor-Critic-Methods-Paper-To-Code). 

## How it works?

Add the [*reward_function.py*](reward_function.py) and 
[*central-agent-ddpg-tensorflow.ipynb*](central-agent-ddpg-tensorflow.ipynb) file, and also the
[*DDPG_Agent*](DDPG_Agent) folder to the cloned repository. Once done that, run the 
[*central-agent-ddpg-tensorflow.ipynb*](central-agent-ddpg-tensorflow.ipynb) file, which is a self content file to see
the trainin process of the DDPG agent.
